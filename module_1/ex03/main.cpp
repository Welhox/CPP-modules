/*
Forbidden functions : None
Implement a Weapon class that has:
• A private attribute type, which is a string.
• A getType() member function that returns a const reference to type.
• A setType() member function that sets type using the new one passed as parameter.
Now, create two classes: HumanA and HumanB. They both have a Weapon and a
name. They also have a member function attack() that displays (of course, without the
angle brackets):
<name> attacks with their <weapon type>
HumanA and HumanB are almost the same except for these two tiny details:
• While HumanA takes the Weapon in its constructor, HumanB doesn’t.
• HumanB may not always have a Weapon, whereas HumanA will always be armed.
